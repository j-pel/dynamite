The author is using it as a vehicle for learning Elixir. For any serious job, please consider more mature frameworks such as Phoenix.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that is so simple yet well featured, flexible and performant, it could be useful for some use cases. The author have several instances running smoothly on production environments 24/7 in both Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\n## Instructions:\r\n\r\nWith Erlang/Elixir installed, clone the repo and run within the cloned directory:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n    mix deps.get\r\n    mix deps.compile\r\n    cp config/config.sample config/config.exs\r\n    iex -S mix\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThen, open a browser to localhost:8080. There is a sample site configured to serve static and dynamic content, including broadcasting through websockets.\r\n\r\nSeveral sites could be configured to work at the same time and from different locations. It is possible to change the content of the site dynamically without ever stopping the server.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to setup a working site on Dynamite. Each site is composed by:\r\n\r\n* Routes: one or more Cowboy routing as EEx dynamic files \r\n* Views: dynamic HTML with EEx parsing\r\n* Static: browser side functionality and static resources\r\n\r\nThe routes and views are parsed at runtime and served dynamically, so they could be modified at any time, thus facilitating the development of web applications.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a performant web application, the programmer should find a good balance between server side and browser side functionality. For example, one method to optimize the flow of data is to use a front end datastore with sync capabilities to the back end database. The browser should handle all the user interaction, formatting, data sanitization and layout (bells and whistles) while the server should handle the data retrieval and storage.\r\n\r\nThere is a sample site included in the repository that used [Pouchdb](https://pouchdb.com/api.html) as a front end for [Couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) for all the data handling. The sample site includes several javascript libraries for enhancing the browser functionality:\r\n\r\n* [Momentjs](http://momentjs.com/docs)\r\n* [Chartjs](http://nnnick.github.io/Chart.js/docs-v2/) \r\n* [Dynamize](http://j-pel.github.io/dynamize)\r\n\r\n## Mode of employ\r\n\r\nFor real life scenarios, a site should bind to port 80 (or 443). It is strongly suggested to run the server without root priviledges (avoid using `sudo` to launch the server). It is possible to use authbind and then launch Dynamite as follows:\r\n ```\r\n# sudo apt-get install authbind\r\n# sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80\r\n# sudo chown user /etc/authbind/byport/80\r\n# sudo chmod 755 /etc/authbind/byport/80\r\n# cd /home/user/path/to/dynamite\r\n# authbind --deep mix run --name web@example.com --no-halt > test/service.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &\r\n``` \r\nThe last command launches an instance of a beam virtual machine, redirecting stdout to a log file.\r\n\r\nTo start Dynamite on an `iex` console, binding to port 80 without root priviledges use:\r\n```\r\n# authbind --deep iex -S mix\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## License:\r\n\r\nThis code is released under the MIT license.
